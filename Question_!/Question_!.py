    #1)  What is the avg lead time for the winter season? And what is the avg lead time for the summer time?
    # 2) Which time periods see more families with children in the summer â€“ weekdays or weekends?
    #    And during the winter, are families with children more prevalent than those without children?
    # 3) In which month can we see the highest waiting list?
    # 4) Is there any connection between the lead time and the cancel status?
    # 5) How do the dynamics of invitations differ between resort hotels and city hotels?
